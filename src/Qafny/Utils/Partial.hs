-- | Compute the dynamic bound applicable to phase, amplitude, and ket
-- representations from the specs.
--
-- For example, if `Îº1` has two specs with interval `[0..10]` and `[10..20]`,
-- we take its lub `[0..20]`
--
-- Static bounds which can be extracted directly from the kinding information is
-- not gathered here.
