//The Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm proof in Qafny
//basically, we use the same strategy as DJ algorithm.
//Now, it is not balanced and constant, but it is dot product, we need to have a dot product operation
//we need to have a way to say for any bitstring. like for any k, n2b(k) is any bitstring
//another possibility is to have s to be nat, then, we can use b2n to cast s to list bool

  // f is either balanced or constant.  we need to assume that f is a length n bit vector, or k is max at 2^n
  //balance means that forall k :: 0 <= k < 2^(n-1) ==> f(k) == 0 /\ forall k :: 2^(n-1) <= k < 2^n == f(k) == 1
  //constant means that forall k :: 0 <= k < 2^n ==> f(k) == 0 , f(k) == 0 is enough, because f(k) == 1 is just a mirror of the f(k) == 0 case.
